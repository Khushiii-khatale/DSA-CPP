Print 1 to N using Recursion

Given an integer n, write a function to print all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) using recursion.

You must not use any loops such as for, while, or do-while.
The function should print each number on a separate line, in increasing order from 1 to n.

Examples:
Input: n = 5

Output:
1  
2  
3  
4  
5
